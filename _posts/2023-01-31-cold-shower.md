Maa thinks I'm like a [wheat weevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_weevil). I don't like water much, so in winter, I mostly avoid taking showers. It's not something I'm proud of, but it doesn't define my character either. During summer, I find myself dreading water. It feels so nice once I take a shower, but there's always a shift in thought when I tell myself, *after I finish this specific task, I'll take a shower*. Yet, when the time comes, I end up sitting right in front of my computer instead.

This pattern doesn't happen between April and October when the weather is warmer, and showers are more inviting. But during the rest of the year, I often struggle with it. It's a quirky habit, and although it's not ideal, it's just one of those things that make me, well, me. My mom might think I'm a bit peculiar, but I know it's just a small part of who I am

__*But not anymore*__ :sunglasses:. I didn't set any New Year resolutions, but I decided that I'd take cold showers for thirty days. Hell yeah, and I did it. The whole January, at around 6 am, I took a cold shower. I even filled up the tub at night so the water would get even more chilled by morning. Was it bone-chilling? Absolutely. Some days, it caused minor pain in my ears, but whatever. I was done being a rat.

It might not seem like a big deal, but to me, it was monumental. I overcame all the excuses I used to make about not taking showers in winter, and it felt amazing. Five minutes after the shower, my body would get so warm, it actually made things better. And instead of using a towel to dry off, I’d open the bathroom door and let the cold air do its job. I felt like a freaking superhero. It was such an awesome feeling.

I mean, who knew that turning into an icicle every morning could be so empowering? Not to mention, it gave me some stories to flex about. My mom was probably convinced I'd lost my mind since this was new to her. But hey, it was worth it. Sometimes, pushing through discomfort is just what you need to remind yourself that you’re capable of more than you think. Plus, it turns out I make a pretty good human popsicle.

I just want to thank Dr. Andrew Huberman for his podcast, [Using Deliberate Cold Exposure for Health and Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq6WHJzOkno). He single-handedly made me do something I would have avoided doing even this year as well.
