How does someone with supposedly good intentions end up causing harm? I keep encountering people who are widely regarded as "good" or "virtuous," yet their actions tell a different story. What's particularly unsettling is how these stories are often shared in hushed tones, with careful words chosen to protect reputations. But this very protection seems to cast an even darker shadow on their character – the more people try to shield them, the more suspicious their behavior appears.

I'm speaking broadly here, not about specific individuals. This is more of a personal reflection, a reminder to myself about maintaining healthy boundaries. I've learned to be wary of those whose kindness seems conditional – those "nice" people whose friendliness fluctuates based on what they can gain from you, whether it's social status, favors, or other benefits.

People often label me as conservative or closed-minded because I don't embrace everything with open arms. But I question this criticism – how can you build a solid foundation for your life if you're willing to accept anything and everything without discrimination? Having no biases or boundaries doesn't make you more enlightened; it might just mean you're willing to accept situations that could ultimately harm you. The absence of judgment isn't always wisdom.

I'm often told I should be more "empathetic," more accepting, more open. But I've seen the dark side of unconditional acceptance. I'm genuinely afraid of the devastating consequences that can come from letting the wrong people or influences into your life. Some might call this fear paranoia, but I see it as self-preservation. I consciously choose to maintain these boundaries rather than fall into what I see as a dangerous trap of being an "empath" – someone who's so open to others that they lose sight of their own wellbeing.
