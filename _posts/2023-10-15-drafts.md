I'm not sure if I've mentioned this in any of my posts or to people, but I have a ton of drafts I'd like to publish. So here I am, talking about it one more time, but for the final time. I was recently checking my drafts, and it was overwhelming to see how the numbers have increased throughout the year. I remember back in the day, it was around 10 or 20, but now it's over 250. The massive surge happened during 2021 and 2022. I don't think there's any necessity to go back to any of them and write, so I'll leave them as they are.

For me, writing is a way to express what I feel and throw out what I don't want to, and it's more of a habit than a hobby. It's also spontaneous and reflective of my current state of mind, rather than a chore to be completed. Maybe that's why I'm not interested in writing for the sake of writing; finishing those drafts would bore me to death. It's not that I can't finish what I started, but when things are left alone for a longer period of time, they lose their sense and meaning, becoming irrelevant in the present context.

Each draft represents a moment in time, capturing my thoughts and emotions as they were. Revisiting them feels like trying to recreate a past that no longer holds the same significance. I don't hold on to the past really well. I want to focus on different things now.

*Cheers* :beer:
