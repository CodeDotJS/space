Hi, I’m Rishi. I move slowly and build things. One of the reasons I like building tools is that they were once just ideas in my head when I was diving deep into the void *(getting bored)*, and it’s refreshing to see those ideas take form.


There is nothing extraordinary about me, but I consider myself an enthusiastic learner. I am mostly driven by curiosity, deadlines, and a bit of stress. Sometimes, the driving factor can also be an obsession with seeing the result or the fear of procrastination. On a bad day, I experience everything all at once.

I have a strong passion for working towards a purpose, and I find reasonable joy in pursuing it. My interests lie in everything JavaScript and Python related, as well as a bit of reverse engineering, operating systems, and **most importantly** -- daydreaming about mastering low-level engineering. If time is not an issue, I’m usually all in for breaking things, figuring them out, and rebuilding them — it helps me understand how things work under the hood.

Besides the usual, I'm really interested in subjects like history, philosophy, politics, religion, neuroscience, and psychology. I find it rewarding to dive into these topics and gain new insights, as they give me a different perspective on the world. I'm not an expert in any of them (*well, no shit, sherlock!*) , so I approach these subjects with an open mind and a genuine desire to learn more without any preconceived notions or biases. I'm extremely biased.

I don’t consider myself an avid reader or writer, but I do make efforts to read and write from time to time. Writing is the only way I can truly express myself, and I read because I like the idea of having something read *(past tense)*. I have a [blog](blog) where I share my thoughts and feelings, and a wiki which captures a good portion of my life. I'll never make it public because it's hosted locally.

I admire Aaron Swartz. He’s been a great inspiration to me for a long time.
