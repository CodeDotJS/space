A not-so-comprehensive list of resources that I actually use and haven't panic-bookmarked out of fear of losing them. One thing I've realized is that if it's important, I'll remember at least a bit of it. If it's not, I'll save it just in case I might need it somedayâ€”which, let's be honest, almost never happens.
