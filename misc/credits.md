<span class="highlight-black">__*no wheel reinvention*__</span>

<img width="150px" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/simpsons.svg" alt="">
{: .center}

I've heavily [customized]({{site.baseurl}}/features){: .highlight-black } a good portion of this site, and many elements were inspired by or copied from other people's work. Since I can't mention them every time I use their work, I'd like to give them permanent space here on this page.
