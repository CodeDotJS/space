I'm not great at writing project descriptions, so you might as well just hit that damn &nbsp; <i class="fa fa-github"></i> &nbsp; to view the source code, &nbsp; <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-link"></i> &nbsp; to see the project live, and &nbsp; <i class="fa fa-pen"></i> &nbsp; to read the blog post. Never been a buzzword expert when it comes to describing simple things.
